## Purpose

Fitness class booking system 
This app is going to deliver a booking system for fitness lovers everywhere to be able to book classes in their local gym. This allows the users to create account, browse the different open classes and time available and make payments for the classes. 

Previously, the gym would take the payments and bookings manually and taking attendance on spreadsheets. 
This could lead to human error and also limits the booking times to business hours. With this app, clients can make bookings at anytime from home and on their phone and can easily see the availability of the classes.

#### Class timetable search
