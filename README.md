## Purpose

Fitness class booking system 
This app is going to deliver a booking system for fitness lovers everywhere to be able to book classes in their local gym. This allows the users to create account, browse the different open classes and time available and make payments for the classes. 

Previously, the gym would take the payments and bookings manually and taking attendance on spreadsheets. 
This could lead to human error and also limits the booking times to business hours. With this app, clients can make bookings at anytime from home and on their phone and can easily see the availability of the classes. 


## Functionality/ feature
#### User registration and Authentication 
- To book classes, users must create new accounts first, so they can be contacted for any changes in class times and also to make payment and keep track of their user date. 
- Users can create, edit and delete own account

- Admin users will have authorisation to make changes to regular users such as deleting or creating them. Admin users can also make posts for available classes and update them as they go. 

#### Class timetable  

- Users can search for the different types of classes such as pilates, yoga, group training classes etc. 
- Users can view all the available sessions in a weekly time.
